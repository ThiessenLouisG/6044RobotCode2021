Read the licence before downloading or using.

I want this mostly as a repository for my FRC teams robot code that multiple laptops can download and upload to.
If someone who isn't on the 6044 Circuit Breakers team comes across this and finds it helpful in any way then I'm glad
Regardless of who is the viewer I hope this can be used later as an example of what and what not to do for the programming.

Cheers,
        Louis
